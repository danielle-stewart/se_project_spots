# Project 3: Spots

This is the third project of the Software Engineering program at TripleTen. It was created using HTML and CSS, based on the design brief and the design from the project on Figma.This webpage is intended to be an image sharing site.

### Overview

- Intro
- Figma
- Project Demo

## Project features

- Semantic HTML5
- Flexbox
- Positioning
- Flat BEM file structure
- A custom form
- CSS
- Responsive Design

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: For structuring content
- **CSS**: For styling and layout
- **Figma**: For design and prototyping

## Diployment

This webpage is deployed to GitHub Pages

**Intro**

This project is made so all the elements are displayed correctly on popular screen sizes. We recommend investing more time in completing this project, since it's more difficult than previous ones.

**Figma**

## Plan on improving the project

Sprint three was by far the most challenging task that I have been assigned in the Tripleten program. Learning how to work on various parts of creating a webpage is a challenging and useful way to exercise front end development skills. In future projects, I would like to have more opportunities to practice making sure that I can successfully produce the design given to me via the brief or in the use of Figma design. Some of the areas that I need more practicing are learning where the margins collapse and I need to improve my skills of using the Dev tools. After completeing this project, I see the benefit of practicing BEM methodology and look forward to improving my skills in the future. I understand that there is a lot of fine detail that goes into producing the webpage displayed for the user. Overall I was challenged with using Figma for the first time, but look forward to using it in the future to improve my software development skills.
